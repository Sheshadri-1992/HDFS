Roger Federer (German: [ˈfeːdərər] born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 3 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).[3] His accomplishments in professional tennis cause him to be regarded by many as the greatest tennis player of all time.[a] Federer turned professional in 1998 and has been continuously ranked in the top 10 since October 2002.
Federer holds several records of the Open Era: holding the world No. 1 position for 302 weeks[17][18] (including 237 consecutive weeks);[19] winning 17 Grand Slam singles titles; reaching each Grand Slam final at least five times (an all-time record); and reaching the Wimbledon final ten times. He is among the seven men (and among the four in Open Era) to capture a career Grand Slam. Federer shares an Open Era record for most titles at Wimbledon with Pete Sampras (7) and at the US Open with Jimmy Connors and Sampras (5).
Federer has reached 27 men's singles Grand Slam finals, including 10 in a row from the 2005 Wimbledon Championships to the 2007 US Open, both statistics being records. He also appeared in 18 of 19 finals from the 2005 Wimbledon through to the 2010 Australian Open. He reached the semifinals at 23 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments, from the 2004 Wimbledon Championships through the 2010 Australian Open.[20] At the 2016 Australian Open, he played in a record 65th consecutive Grand Slam tournament, reached a record 47th Grand Slam quarterfinal and a record 39th Grand Slam semifinal. Earlier at the 2015 US Open, he reached a record 27th Grand Slam final. Also earlier at the 2013 French Open, Federer reached a record 36th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal.

Federer's ATP tournament records include winning a record six ATP World Tour Finals, playing in the finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (a record shared with Djokovic and Nadal), and having won the most prize money of any player in history. He also won the Olympic gold medal in doubles with his compatriot Stan Wawrinka at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games and the Olympic silver medal in singles at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. Representing Switzerland, he was a part of the 2014 winning Davis Cup team. He spent eight years (2003–2010) continuously in the top 2 in the year-end men's rankings and ten (2003–2012) in the top 3.

Personal life
Childhood and early life
Federer was born at the Basel Cantonal Hospital in Basel, Switzerland.[21] His father, Robert Federer, is Swiss, from Berneck, near the borders between Switzerland, Austria and Germany; and his mother, Lynette Federer (born Durand), from Kempton Park, Gauteng, is a South African whose ancestors were Dutch and French Huguenots.[22][23] Federer has one sibling, his older sister Diana,[24] who is the mother of a set of twins.[25] He holds both Swiss and South African citizenship.[26] He grew up in nearby Birsfelden, Riehen, and then Münchenstein, close to the French and German borders and speaks Swiss German, Standard German, English and French fluently, Swiss German being his native language.[21][23][27][28]

Federer's signature
Federer was raised as a Roman Catholic and met Pope Benedict XVI while playing the 2006 Internazionali BNL d'Italia tournament in Rome.[29] Like all male Swiss citizens, Federer was subject to compulsory military service in the Swiss Armed Forces. However, in 2003 he was deemed unfit because of a long-standing back problem and was subsequently not required to fulfill his military obligation.[30] Luckily, he managed to overcome this ailment enough to win Wimbledon later that year. He grew up supporting F.C. Basel and the Swiss National Football Team.[31] Federer also credits the range of sports he played as a child—he also played badminton and basketball—for his hand-eye coordination.[32]

Federer is married to former Women's Tennis Association player Mirka Vavrinec. He met her while both were competing for Switzerland in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Vavrinec retired from the tour in 2002 because of a foot injury.[33] They were married at Wenkenhof Villa in Riehen near Basel on 11 April 2009, surrounded by a small group of close friends and family.[34] In July 2009, Mirka gave birth to identical twin girls, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva.[35] The Federers had another set of twins in 2014, this time boys whom they named Leo and Lennart,[36] called Lenny.[37]
Philanthropy and outreach
In 2003, he established the Roger Federer Foundation to help disadvantaged children and to promote their access to education and sports.[38][39][40] Since May 2004, citing his close ties with South Africa including because that is where his mother was raised, he started supporting the South Africa-Swiss charity IMBEWU which helps children better connect to sports and social and health awareness and, in 2005, Federer visited South Africa to meet the children that had benefited from his support.[41][42][43] In 2005, he auctioned his racquet from his US Open championship to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina.[44] At the 2005 Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, Federer arranged an exhibition involving several top players from the ATP and WTA tour called Rally for Relief. The proceeds went to the victims of the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. In December 2006 he visited Tamil Nadu, one of the areas in India most affected by the tsunami.[45] He was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador by UNICEF in April 2006 and has appeared in UNICEF public messages to raise public awareness of AIDS.[46][47] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he arranged a collaboration with fellow top tennis players for a special charity event during the 2010 Australian Open called 'Hit for Haiti', in which proceeds went to Haiti earthquake victims.[48][49] He participated in a follow-up charity exhibition during the 2010 Indian Wells Masters which raised $1 million.[50] The Nadal vs Federer "Match for Africa" in 2010 in Zurich and Madrid raised more than $4 million for the Roger Federer Foundation and Fundación Rafa Nadal. In January 2011 Federer took part in an exhibition, Rally for Relief, to raise money for the victims of the Queensland floods.[51][52] In 2014 the Match for Africa 2 between Federer and Stan Wawrinka, again in Zurich, raised £850,000 for education projects in southern Africa.[53]
